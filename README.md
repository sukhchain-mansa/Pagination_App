# Pagination_App
Create a pagination app assuming there are thousands of database records that we need to display in user friendly way using pagination. The UI will be rendered using Pug template engine from the server itself. There should also be options for sorting the results, sort by gender, registration date, name etc. See if you can also implement a search feature.
